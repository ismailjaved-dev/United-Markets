                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  The use of computer algorithms and systems to trade on the
                  market according to pre-set strategies that do not require
                  direct human intervention.

                <p class="segment-title">Appreciation</p>
                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  An increase in the value of a currency. For example, if
                  USD/JPY rises from 105.00 to 110.00, the USD has appreciated
                  against the JPY.

                <p class="segment-title">Arbitrage</p>
                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  A strategy that involves taking advantage of the price
                  discrepancy between two markets, typically by buying an
                  instrument in one market at a lower price and simultaneously
                  selling it in another market at a higher price. For example,
                  suppose EUR/USD is trading at 1.2000 on one platform and
                  1.2005 on another. As an arbitrageur, you could buy on the
                  first platform at a lower price and immediately sell on the
                  other, making a profit of 0.0005.

                <p class="segment-title">Ascending Triangle</p>
                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  This is a bullish pattern characterised by a flat top and a
                  rising bottom.

                <p class="segment-title">Ask Price</p>
                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  The price at which a seller is willing to sell a currency. In
                  the above example, the ask price is 1.1103.

                <p class="segment-title">Bear Market</p>
                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  Conversely, a bear market refers to a condition where prices
                  are falling or are expected to fall, usually by 20% or more
                  from recent highs. In a bear market, investors often turn
                  pessimistic about the state of the market, fearing further
                  losses. These markets usually occur during economic recessions
                  or downturns, when unemployment is rising, and inflation is
                  potentially high.
                </p>

                <p class="segment-title">Bid Price</p>
                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  The price a buyer is willing to pay for a currency. If the
                  EUR/USD is quoted as 1.1100/1.1103, the bid price is 1.1100.
                </p>

                <p class="segment-title">Bollinger Bands</p>
                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  A technical analysis tool defined by a set of lines plotted
                  two standard deviations away from a simple moving average. The
                  bands widen when volatility increases and narrow when
                  volatility decreases.
                </p>

                <p class="segment-title">Breakeven</p>
                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  This is the point at which, if the trade were closed at that
                  moment, there would be a net $0 gain. No gains and also no
                  losses.
                </p>

                <p class="segment-title">Breakout</p>
                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  When the price of a currency moves above a resistance level or

                  This term refers to a market condition where prices are either

                  markets are often associated with strong economic performance

                  Then the trendline angle increases to about 45 degrees as the
                  market advances rapidly, forming the "bump". Then the trend

                  It is used when a trader expects the price of a currency to

                  sets a buy-stop order at a level above the current market
                  price, predicting that the upward trend will continue after

                  A change in the direction of a price trend. For example, if
                  GBP/USD has been falling but then starts rising, that's a
                  reversal.

                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  The process of identifying and mitigating trading risks. This
                  might involve setting stop-loss orders to limit potential

                  Risk-on is market sentiment where traders are willing to take
                  on more risk, typically benefiting higher-yielding currencies.
                  Risk-off is when traders are risk-averse, typically benefiting
                  safe-haven currencies like the USD, JPY, and CHF.

                  The interest that you earn or owe for holding a currency
                  position overnight. Each currency has an overnight interest
                  rate associated with it, and because forex is traded in pairs,
                  every trade involves not only two different currencies but
                  also two different interest rates.

                  This chart pattern is observed when a series of market

                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  This is a pending order used when a trader expects the price
                  of a currency to rise before it falls. The trader sets a Sell
                  Limit order at a value above the current market price,
                  predicting that the price will reverse and fall after reaching
                  the predetermined level.

                  This is a pending order that a trader uses when they expect
                  the currency price to fall past a certain level and then
                  continue falling. They set a sell-stop order at a value below

                <p class="segment-title">Short Position</p>
                <p class="segment-explanation">
                  A 'short' position is the opposite of a long position. When a
                  trader goes 'short' on a currency pair, it means they are
                  selling the base currency and simultaneously buying the quote
                  currency. They are betting that the base currency will weaken
                  against the quote currency. If it does, they can make a
                  profit. For example, if a trader believes that the EUR will
                  weaken against the USD, they will go short on the EUR/USD
                  pair.

                  For example, if you place an order to buy EUR/USD at 1.1800
                  but it gets filled at 1.1802, that's slippage.

                  time. The theory suggests that it's possible to predict a
                  price reversal when the oscillator crosses above or below
                  extreme values.

                <p class="segment-title">Stop-Loss Order</p>

            HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING: We emphasize the critical nature of
            informed decision-making in the world of financial trading. Engaging
            in leveraged trading involving foreign currency contracts, contracts
            for difference, or other off-exchange products carries a heightened
            level of risk, and it may not be suitable for everyone. Prior to
            embarking on any trading activities, we strongly advise all
            potential traders to diligently read and comprehend the relevant
            risk disclosures and warnings available on our platform. It is
            paramount to acknowledge the substantial risk that one may lose
            their entire initial investment. Considering the diverse and dynamic
            nature of financial markets, we recommend that individuals carefully
            assess whether trading leveraged products aligns with their unique
            personal circumstances. Seeking independent financial advice is
            highly encouraged to gain a nuanced understanding of all associated
            risks before entering the world of financial trading. Moreover, the
            inherent risks of trading through an online platform are explicitly
            addressed, and users are urged to refer to our dedicated Regulation
            section for additional insights.
